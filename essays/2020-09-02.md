## My Programing Experience

My initial exposure to coding was writing firmware for applications in robotics. I learned to write C, specifically for Arduinos in order to design robot control systems. After starting college, my first programming class also used C. However, this class taught me how to use the language to create software meant to run on a computer rather than some external piece of hardware like a robot. Through my coursework I also learned C++. In my free time I have also been teaching myself Python to use at my job. Completing assignments for ICS 314 was the first time I had used Javascript.

## How Does Javascript Compare?

Given that Javascript is an object oriented language it was very similar to C++. My previous experience with C++ helped a lot because I already had a solid understanding of objects and how they behave. However, Javascript is much easier and more convenient to use in comparison. For example, when creating an object in C++ you also need to program separate functions within the object to retrieve or change the data stored in its different properties. In Javascript, those functions are built into the language. 
The way Javascript handles variables is very similar to Python. Unlike, in C and C++, Javascript variables don’t need to be labeled with a specific type like “int”,” char”, etc. Being able to call all variables “var” or “let” makes coding a little quicker and reduces the amount of potential compiling errors. 


## Athletic Software Engineering

I found the WODs useful, especially as a new user of Javascript. It allowed me to get used to the language's syntax while also serving as a warm up after summer break. I think this style of learning is unique as it encourages students to not only solve the problem but to do it in a time effective manner. This seems like a useful skill to have as a software engineer. 
I found the WODs pretty fun as it made writing simpler pieces of code more exciting. I think Javascript has a lot of time saving features and makes this type of athletic programming more enjoyable. When it came time to solve longer, more challenging problems, I noticed after a certain amount of time I would forget about the timer and just focused on finding a solution. I think in order to get more out of these exercises I need to break that habit.

## Is Javascript a Good Language?

From the little exposure I have, Javascript seems like a very good language for software engineers. In my opinion, the difference between Javascript and C++ set it apart in a great way. Javascript also is a great language to try a more athletic style of programming with. In conclusion, Javascript seems to have the same capabilities as other object oriented languages like C++ but with features designed with the convenience of the programmer in mind.
